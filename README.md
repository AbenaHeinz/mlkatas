# â›© Machine Learning Katas (archived)

> The content of this repository has been merged into the [Machine Learning Handbook](https://github.com/bpesquet/mlhandbook). It is now archived and won't be updated anymore.

This repository contains a series of challenges (_katas_) for practicing your Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills.

The katas are self-correcting [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that can be executed either:

- online, by accessing the [katas website](https://bpesquet.github.io/mlkatas/) and using a Jupyter cloud service like [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Google account needed) or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

- locally, by cloning or downloading this repository then spinning up a Jupyter notebook server on your local machine.

The katas are generated by [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io).
